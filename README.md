# Rescue-Management-System---8051-Microcontroller
The aim of the project is to use a microcontroller to regulate the
transfer of human victims from point to point. Multiple points in
the locality will have RFID based device that can record the
detected tag information and its related vitals. The victim’s body
will be scanned at multiple points in the journey. Any point that
doesn’t show a consistent vital can be attended to by calling
emergency doctors at that point. If the patient is trafficked or any
one point doesn’t show RFID reading, there will be a police
inspection on that patient’s current location based on last scanned
location. This will avoid the slightest chances of a mishap.
This system can be deployed in disaster time in patients’
management systems and in Realtime vitals communication to the
doctors. It will avoid human errors and can register large data in a
very less amount of time. The system is very helpful as it provides
effective identification method for the patients along with security
of information stored. This device displays potential to fit military
use cases and to prevent trafficking of humans (child and woman
trafficking).
